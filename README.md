# ***Customs Goods Tracking System***

In this project, we have tried to develop a system, which can enlist and keep track of data
on customs goods that are imported through two ports in Bangladesh. In this system, the
main site is *Patenga* port and it will maintain the whole system. And we have a secondary
site named *Mongla* port that directly works under *Patenga* port. The system will handle the
maintenance of data.


The system is developed for the usage of the employees working in respective ports. They
can enter the information of products that are imported through the ports, shipment
information, also importer details in the system. They can also update the status of products
and shipments. The system admin can enlist the tariff information of the different types of
products.
